# Kash Builds - Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my work as a Web3 developer and creative technologist. The site is designed to be a dynamic and interactive experience, reflecting my passion for building innovative digital solutions.

Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and brought to life with animations from **Framer Motion** and physics-based interactions with **Matter.js**.
