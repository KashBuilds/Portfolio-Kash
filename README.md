# Kash Builds - Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my work as a Web3 developer and creative technologist. The site is designed to be a dynamic and interactive experience, reflecting my passion for building innovative digital solutions. 

Every step of the user journey has been thoughtfully designed and perfected for maximum clarity and ease.

Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and brought to life with animations from **Framer Motion** and physics-based interactions with **Matter.js**.
